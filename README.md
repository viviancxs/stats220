# WELCOME
Welcome to my first proper repository! https://github.com/viviancxs/stats220

## Purpose of this Repository
This repository was made as part of the first Assignment for **STATS 220 (Data Technologies)**, Semester 1 2022.

I have created an original **meme** and an original **GIF**.

Many thanks to this page, I learned a few more things outside of the lectures: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html#Transformations

Many thanks to Anna for getting us to do this as part of the course! About time I learn how to actually use my Github account.
